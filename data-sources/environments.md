# Environments

This page explains multiple datasource environments, which allows developers to isolate their testing and production datasources.

### Overview[â€‹](https://docs.appsmith.com/connect-data/concepts/Datasource-Environments#overview) <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Multiple environments allow you to display and test against nonsensitive (non-production) data. You can set up connections to your data sources (e.g., database or API) and add environment-specific credentials within the same data sources.

This allows you to create queries and switch between environments, with the queries automatically using the selected environment.



**1. Accessing the Environments Page:**

* Log in to your account and navigate to the main dashboard.
* Locate and click on the "Environments" section to access the list of existing environments.

* Click on this option to open a form where you can input details for the new environment.

* Once complete, save the new environment.

**3. Deleting an Existing Environment:**

* In the "Environments" list, identify the environment you want to delete.
* Next to the environment entry, look for a "Delete" or "Remove" option.
* Confirm the deletion when prompted. Be cautious, as this action is irreversible.

**4. Updating an Existing Environment:**

* Locate the environment you wish to update in the "Environments" list.
* Click on the environment entry to open its detailed view or edit form.
* Modify the necessary details, such as environment name or description.
* Save the changes to update the existing environment.
