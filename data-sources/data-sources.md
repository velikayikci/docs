# Data Sources

Start building your apps by connecting your data source. Flowfy allows connecting your data from a database or with any API:

* databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.);
* internal APIs.

The data sources in Flowfy are global, meaning that once set up, each data source can be used across different applications. You can manage data sources access permissions for different user roles.

### Managing Data Sources

Welcome to the Data Sources management page! This section of your application allows you to seamlessly handle your database connections, whether it's adding a new one, updating an existing connection, or removing unnecessary sources. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you navigate through these operations:

**1. Accessing the Data Sources Page:**

* Log in to your account and navigate to the main dashboard.
* Locate and click on the "Data Sources" section to access the list of existing connections from navigation menu.

**2. Adding a New Database Connection:**

* On the "Data Sources" page, look for an option to "New" or a similar label.
* Click on this option to open a form where you can input details for the new database connection.
* Fill in the required information, such as connection name, host, username, password, and any other relevant details.

**3. Deleting an Existing Database Connection:**

* In the "Data Sources" list, identify the connection you want to delete.
* Next to the connection entry, look for a "Delete" or "Remove" option.
* Confirm the deletion when prompted. Be cautious, as this action is irreversible.

**4. Updating an Existing Database Connection:**

* Locate the connection you wish to update in the "Data Sources" list.
* Click on the connection entry to open its detailed view or edit form.
* Modify the necessary details, such as host, username, or password.
* Save the changes to update the existing connection.

Congratulations! You have successfully managed your data sources. This streamlined process allows you to stay in control of your database connections, ensuring that your application's data is always up-to-date and accessible.
