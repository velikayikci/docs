# Invite Users

### Invite Users

Inviting users to your app allows you to provide access to individuals who don't already have an account in your application. When you invite a user, they will receive an email with a link to create an account and access your application.

#### Inviting Users

To invite a user to your app, follow these steps:

* Navigate to the "Users" section in the platform's menu.
* Click the "Invite User" button.
* Enter the user's email address.
* Choose the roles and/or organization units you want to assign to the user.
* Add any additional notes for the user, if desired.
* Save the invitation.

Once the invitation is saved, the user will receive an email with a link to create an account in your application. The email will also contain any notes you added for the user.
