# Pages

### Overview

Pages is a feature of our platform that allows users to create custom screens and interfaces using a live visual designer. With Pages, users can easily design and build their own screens with drag-and-drop functionality, making it simple to bring their ideas to life without writing any code.

### Key Features

* **Live Visual Designer:** Pages provides a live visual designer interface, allowing users to see their changes in real-time as they design their screens. This enables rapid prototyping and iterative design processes.
* **Drag and Drop:** Users can add elements to their screens by simply dragging and dropping components from the toolbar onto the canvas. This intuitive interface makes it easy to arrange and customize elements without any coding required.
* **Customizable Layouts:** Pages supports customizable layouts, allowing users to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. Users can arrange elements freely and adjust their properties to achieve the desired layout.
* **Component Library:** Pages includes a library of pre-built components that users can use to quickly add common UI elements such as buttons, input fields, and navigation bars to their screens. Users can also create their own custom components for reuse.
* **Interactivity:** Users can add interactivity to their screens by defining actions and events for UI elements. This allows users to create dynamic and engaging experiences for their users without writing any code.
