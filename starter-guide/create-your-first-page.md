**Step 6: Add Functionality (Optional)**

* Depending on your page's purpose, you may want to add functionality. For example, if it's a contact form, link the form elements to a data storage component. If it's a product showcase, link buttons to detailed product pages.

**Step 7: Preview Your Page**

* Before finalizing, use the preview feature to see how your page will appear to users.
* Test any interactive elements to ensure they function as intended.

**Step 8: Save and Publish**

* Once satisfied with your page, save your work.
* If you're ready to make the page live, look for a "Publish" button. Clicking this will make your new page accessible to users.
* Click Reload Pages & Permissions to see your new page in navigation menu.
